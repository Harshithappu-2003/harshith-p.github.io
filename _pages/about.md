 👨🏻‍💻I am a pre-final year student at REVA University, Bengaluru.

🔬 My interests lie in exploring the intersection of machine learning and real-world applications, especially in domains like web development, AR/VR, and blockchain.

📚 As a pre-final year B.Tech student at REVA University, Bengaluru, I’m actively involved in hands-on projects and hackathons, building solutions using technologies like React, Node.js, and data-driven systems.

🤝 I’m passionate about helping fellow students navigate the world of tech and open source. As the Lead of OS-Code at REVA University, I’ve been mentoring peers, organizing technical events, and fostering a collaborative coding culture on campus.

🚀 Beyond academics, I enjoy empowering others through community engagement and leadership, while continuing to grow as a learner in the world of emerging technologies.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
As Chapter Lead of OSCode Community – REVA University, I led 10+ open-source workshops and events that introduced 200+ students to collaborative coding, Git, and GitHub. I mentored 30+ members, fostering a hands-on learning environment that encouraged first-time contributions and open-source engagement.

I also coordinated external collaborations, including a joint event with Masai School, and represented REVA University at the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2024, where I networked with 100+ tech professionals.

## 🎓 Leadership & Community Engagement
My leadership with OSCode and IEEE ComSoc involved driving strategic goals, event planning, and peer mentorship. These experiences strengthened my communication, collaboration, and initiative—core skills that I bring to both technical and team-based work.
