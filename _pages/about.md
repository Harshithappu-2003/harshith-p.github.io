 👨🏻‍💻I am a pre-final year student at REVA University, Bengaluru.

🔬 My interests lie in exploring the intersection of machine learning and real-world applications, especially in domains like web development, AR/VR, and blockchain.

📚 As a pre-final year B.Tech student at REVA University, Bengaluru, I’m actively involved in hands-on projects and hackathons, building solutions using technologies like React, Node.js, and data-driven systems.

🤝 I’m passionate about helping fellow students navigate the world of tech and open source. As the Lead of OS-Code at REVA University, I’ve been mentoring peers, organizing technical events, and fostering a collaborative coding culture on campus.

🚀 Beyond academics, I enjoy empowering others through community engagement and leadership, while continuing to grow as a learner in the world of emerging technologies.



**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
